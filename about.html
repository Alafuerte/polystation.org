          <h4>Angel Perez</h4>
          <p>Angel is a relational coach, inclusion specialist and founder of PolyStation, creating queer-inclusive spaces to rethink how we relate, care and belong. He has a background in sociology, queer studies, ontological coaching and creative writing. He is also a proud father of two and in his spare time he runs a queer club night called <a href="https://www.gayzpacho.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gayzpacho</a>.</p> 
          <p>Drawing on lived experience of polyamory, educational training and years of community and inclusion work, Angel has developed a values-based coaching methodology that helps individuals and groups shift their way of relating to others and themselves. In his approach he blends attachment-informed, trauma-aware ontological practice with critical thinking and playful creativity.</p> 
          <p>Angel offers <a href="https://www.polystation.org/coaching.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coaching and workshops</a> for individuals, couples/polycules, families and teams.</p>
