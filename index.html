      <h2>Welcome to PolyStation</h2>
      <p>PolyStation is a space for reimagining relationships beyond traditional norms and configurations, rooted in principles of non-monogamy, community and kinship. It is a one-stop social space dedicated to discussing how we connect with others and exploring new ways of building positive and diverse relationships.</p>
      <p>No experience required! PolyStation is open to everyone of all genders and sexualities; whether you're actively practising non-monogamy, questioning conventional relationships, opening up or simply curious. Come as you are, bring your questions, and be part of an inclusive community that values honesty, agency and connection in all its forms.</p>

      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><strong>PolyStation</strong> is a movement and community space designed to radically rethink how we relate to one another. Our mission is to challenge the structures of monogamy, individualism, and capitalist-driven isolation by promoting new models of connection rooted in non-monogamy, collective care and chosen kinship. PolyStation aims to inspire a shift toward more pluralistic, collaborative ways of living, loving and ultimately to contribute to a more connected and just society.</p>
