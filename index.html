      <h2>About</h2>
      <p><strong>PolyStation</strong> is a movement and community space designed to radically rethink how we relate to one another. Its mission is to challenge the structures of monogamy, individualism, and capitalist-driven isolation by promoting new models of connection rooted in non-monogamy, collective care, and chosen kinship. PolyStation aims to inspire a shift toward more pluralistic, collaborative ways of living and loving, and ultimately to contribute to a more connected, just, and joyful society.</p>
