        <div class="card">
          <h3>Individual Coaching</h3>
          <p>Personalised sessions exploring your relationship goals and challenges. We help you understand your needs, set healthy boundaries and communicate effectively.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Interpersonal Coaching</h3>
          <p>Sessions in groups of two or more people who are co-creating relationships together. This could be two or more partners, metamours, friends or chosen family who seek to build understanding, negotiate agreements or foster trust and mutual support.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Co-parenting Coaching</h3>
          <p>Bringing up children in alternative family arrangements can be difficult, specially when we don't have referents or role models and when all we have learned about parenting is based on monoparental families. Angel can help you navigate the challenges of co-parenting in enviroments where more than two adults are involved in caring for children.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>What to Expect</h3>
      <p>Our sessions focus on creating a non‑judgmental space where you can be honest about your desires and challenges. We use tools such as reflective listening, values exploration and customised exercises to help you thrive in your relationships. Together we will work to clarify everyone’s needs, set healthy boundaries and develop strategies for managing emotions like resentment, jealousy or insecurity but ultimately creating the foundations of the relationship that works for you.</p>

We operate on a sliding scale to make coaching accessible. Your ability to pay should not be a barrier to getting support. Contact us to discuss rates and find a plan that works for you.</p>
